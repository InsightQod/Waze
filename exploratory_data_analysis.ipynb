    "\n",
    "Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Given the scenario, which data columns are most applicable?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Which data columns can you eliminate, knowing they won’t solve your problem scenario?\n",

    "4.  How would you check for outliers? And how would handle outliers (if any)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SInce we are interested in user churn, the `label` column is essential. Besides `label`, variables that tie to user behaviors will be the most applicable. All variables tie to user behavior except `ID`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `ID` can be dropped from the analysis since we are not interested in identifying a particular user. `ID` does not provide meaningful information about the churn (unless `ID` is assigned based on user sign-up time).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To check for missing data, we can use `df.info()` and inspect the `Non-Null Count` column. The difference between the number of non-nulls and the number of rows in the data is the number of missing values for the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   If the missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR), meaning that the reason for missingness is independent of the data values themselves, we can proceed with a complete-case analysis by removing the rows with missing values. Otherwise, we need to investigate the root cause of the missingness and make sure it won't interfere with the statistical inference and modeling.\n",

Whether you keep outliers as they are, delete them, or reassign values is a decision that you make on a dataset-by-dataset basis, according to what your goals are for the model you are planning to construct. To help you make the decision, you can start with these general guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Delete them: If you are sure the outliers are mistakes, typos, or errors and the dataset will be used for modeling or machine learning, then you are more likely to decide to delete outliers. Of the three choices, you’ll use this one the least.\n",
    "    * Reassign them: If the dataset is small and/or the data will be used for modeling or machine learning, you are more likely to choose a path of deriving new values to replace the outlier values.\n",
    "    * Leave them: For a dataset that you plan to do EDA/analysis on and nothing else, or for a dataset you are preparing for a model that is resistant to outliers, it is most likely that you are going to leave them in.\n",

    "1. What types of distributions did you notice in the variables? What did this tell you about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Nearly all the variables were either very right-skewed or uniformly distributed. For the right-skewed distributions, this means that most users had values in the lower end of the range for that variable. For the uniform distributions, this means that users were generally equally likely to have values anywhere within the range for that variable.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Was there anything that led you to believe the data was erroneous or problematic in any way?\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Most of the data was not problematic, and there was no indication that any single variable was completely wrong. However, several variables had highly improbable or perhaps even impossible outlying values, such as `driven_km_drives`. Some of the monthly variables also might be problematic, such as `activity_days` and `driving_days`, because one has a max value of 31 while the other has a max value of 30, indicating that data collection might not have occurred in the same month for both of these variables.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Did your investigation give rise to further questions that you would like to explore or ask the Waze team about?\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Yes. I'd want to ask the Waze data team to confirm that the monthly variables were collected during the same month, given the fact that some have max values of 30 days while others have 31 days. I'd also want to learn why so many long-time users suddenly started using the app so much in just the last month. Was there anything that changed in the last month that might prompt this kind of behavior?*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What percentage of users churned and what percentage were retained?\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Less than 18% of users churned, and \\~82% were retained.*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What factors correlated with user churn? How?\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Distance driven per driving day had a positive correlation with user churn. The farther a user drove on each driving day, the more likely they were to churn. On the other hand, number of driving days had a negative correlation with churn. Users who drove more days of the last month were less likely to churn.*\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Did newer uses have greater representation in this dataset than users with longer tenure? How do you know?\n",
    "\n",
    "> *No. Users of all tenures from brand new to \\~10 years were relatively evenly represented in the data. This is borne out by the histogram for `n_days_after_onboarding`, which reveals a uniform distribution for this variable.*"
